F @Framework: remember original page and redirect to it in case of successful authentication
    To do so, original page must be saved into session
F @Framework: add error author & mail error reporting (so RELEVANT users will be informed)
    To do so, I must add ErrorListener
F @Framework: login throttling protection
    To do so, login attempts must be saved in session. If they exceed a LIMIT, they should be rejected for a TIME.
F @Framework: make 404 page able to use view language
    To do so, HtmlRenderer must know of "environment".
? @Framework: improve EnvironmentDetector to support detecting by path of project
    In your httpd.conf or a .htaccess file, put:
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
        fastcgi_param   APPLICATION_ENV  development;
    Then in your application, use the getenv function to get the value:
        $environment = getenv("APPLICATION_ENV");
    This would:
        - make ErrorsFrontController act like a real FrontController where routes are Exceptions (only there are no page controllers)
        - remove ErrorListener, then detach all STDERR flow to ErrorsFrontController
        - ErrorsFrontController work with a different XML (eg: errors.xml)
F @ServletsAPI: add application version @ XML (tag: application.version) to force frontend files refresh cache
F @ServletsAPI: <routes ref="XML_PATH"/>
F @ServletsAPI: expand listeners to cover more states (BEFORE & AFTER)
F @ViewLanguageAPI: Tag & attribute names must be able to contain [a-zA-Z0-9-_.]
? @ViewLanguageAPI: template inheritance
F @Oauth2Client: add refresh token support @ Driver
F @NoSQLAPI: check if no-sql Couchbase can be converted to NoSQLServerDataSource
F @all APIs: add namespaces, then composer autoload
D @all APIs: changelogs
