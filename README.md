# oauth2client
Client for OAuth2 applications and drivers implementations.

Why yet another oauth2 client, when there are so many already available here on github for PHP? Because I'm that lazy kind of guy who hates seing code too complicated for no valid reasons. Maybe by virtue of being a natural C/C++ programmer I also love to see code that is simplified to the point of becoming un-decomposable: not a line of code more than absolutely necessary, no bundled libraries, JUST an OAuth2Client and nothing more than that. 

Another reason is that I love simplicity and elegance: not a line of code more than absolutely necessary, no bundled libraries, JUST an OAuth2Client that is simple to use and integrate with endpoint services that use OAuth2 such as Facebook or Google (provided here as an example).
