# Lucinda Framework API

This is the api that's going to be used by lucinda framework.

TODOS:
? @ServletsAPI: allow named path parameters (this makes application SLOW!)
F @ServletsAPI: response content type should be configurable in route (<route ... content_type="..."/>
? @Framework: remember original page and redirect to it in case of unauthorized/ok cycle
F @Framework: add error author & mail error reporting (so RELEVANT users will be infored)
F @NoSQLAPI: add support for redis clusters
F @Oauth2Client: add refresh token support @ Driver
? @ViewLanguage: make library tags direct to procedural files instead of classes

Documentation:
- write docs for remaining api
- integrate framework documentation with apis
- show a dependency graph
