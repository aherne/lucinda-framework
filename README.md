# Lucinda Framework

Lucinda is an art-driven high performance PHP framework designed on principles of simplicity, flexibility and stability for developers with an aesthetic sense as well as clients who want blazing fast and easily maintainable applications. By enforcing those principles, Lucinda fulfills its goals as a high performance web application skeleton that benefits:

- developers: because it is full featured and very easy to learn and extend
- employers: because developers can become productive almost immediately
- clients: because they will enjoy a very fast site

It outperforms any other PHP framework not just in the way it's done, but also in benchmarks where it proves to be 41 times faster than Laravel. 

Once framework is installed, this API will form the skeleton behind your site. It defines basic abilities according to installation choices and expects developers to fill the rest in order to have a working application.
