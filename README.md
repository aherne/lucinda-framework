? @Framework: remember original page and redirect to it in case of unauthorized/ok cycle
? @ServletsAPI: <routes ref="XML_PATH"/>
F @Framework: add error author & mail error reporting (so RELEVANT users will be infored)
F @NoSQLAPI: add support for redis clusters
F @Oauth2Client: add refresh token support @ Driver
? @ViewLanguage: make library tags direct to procedural files instead of classes
